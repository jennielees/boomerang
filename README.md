Boomerang
============

A small server side app written as part of a rapid prototyping startup experience (Founder Labs).

Uses node.js to provide server side component to a mobile app which displays messages and images to the viewer. These are pulled from twitter messages.

The aim was to provide a simplified communication experience for the elderly by removing all the friction around logging in, etc, while allowing more tech-savvy relatives to continue using the platforms they already share content on. 

I can't remember what Dave McClure said about the pitch but it probably wasn't very positive. (:
